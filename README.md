## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! I’m Sebastian, 32 years old and currently training to become a Mobile App Developer (iOS & Android).  
I used to be the go-to tech guy in various companies – now I create apps using SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.  
Creativity has always been my thing – whether behind the camera or in front of the keyboard. Now I blend tech & aesthetics in app development.

My goal? **Build apps that not only work – but are a joy to use.**  
Always with clean code, good UX, and a touch of humor.
